## Recommendations

-  Focus more on Technology and Phone products – promote them in marketing and sales strategies.

-  Increase inventory for high-selling sub-categories like Phones and Chairs.

-  Since Consumers drive most sales, create exclusive offers or loyalty programs for them.

-  Since most orders are Standard Class, explore faster, low-cost shipping options to attract more Same Day or First Class users.

-  Investigate why categories like Home Office are low in sales – is it pricing, demand, or product mix?

-  Suggest accessories or furniture items when customers buy technology items like phones.
