## Recommendations

1.	  Focus more on Technology and Phone products – promote them in marketing and sales strategies.

2.    Increase inventory for high-selling sub-categories like Phones and Chairs.

3.    Since Consumers drive most sales, create exclusive offers or loyalty programs for them.

4.    Since most orders are Standard Class, explore faster, low-cost shipping options to attract more Same Day or First Class users.

5.    Investigate why categories like Home Office are low in sales – is it pricing, demand, or product mix?

6.    Suggest accessories or furniture items when customers buy technology items like phones.
